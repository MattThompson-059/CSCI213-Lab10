This is the Git lab for CSCI 213 Software Development. One class was added, Car.java,
which extends the abstract Vehicle class. The Car class contains the following:

- two instance variables
- a parameterized constructor for all current and super instance variables
- getters for the instance variables in this class
- the toString method
- the equals method
- a copy method
